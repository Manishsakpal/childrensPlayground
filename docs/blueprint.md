## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Use a calm, desaturated blue (#74A0DF) to evoke a sense of creativity and focus.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F7) to ensure that the drawings on each of the layers are clear.
- Accent color: A muted purple (#A074DF) as the analogous accent color for interactive elements.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif, for both headlines and body text, for a clean and modern look.
- Use simple, clear icons for drawing tools and layer controls.
- Ensure a clean and intuitive layout with clear separation between drawing tools and the canvas.
- Subtle transitions when dragging and dropping drawings onto different layers.
